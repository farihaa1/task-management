# Task Management Application

## Overview
This Task Management Application allows users to efficiently manage their tasks using a drag-and-drop interface. Users can add, edit, delete, and reorder tasks, which are categorized into three sections: **To-Do, In Progress, and Done**. The app ensures real-time updates and data persistence through MongoDB, providing a seamless user experience.
